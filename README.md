# python-github-user-activity-cli
This project is a CLI tool that fetches and displays a GitHub user's recent activity using the GitHub API. Users can input a username to view actions like commits, issues, and stars in the terminal. Built using [Python/C#/Java], it showcases skills in API integration, JSON handling, and CLI design without relying on external libraries for requests.
